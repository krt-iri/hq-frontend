### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Iridium HQ - Frontend.  
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.  
When you're creating a bug report, [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).  
Fill out the required template. The information it asks for helps us to resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Check the FAQ** for a list of common questions and problems.
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the problem has already been reported.  
  If it has, **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as Issues. Provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.  
  For example, start by explaining how you started the software. When listing steps, **don't only say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.**  
  Include links to files, other projects, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** that show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- **If you're reporting that Iridium HQ - Frontend crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace.  
  Include the crash report in the issue in [code block](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), a file attachment, or a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide the link to that snippet.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently,** (e.g., after updating to a new version of Iridium HQ - Frontend) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Iridium HQ - Frontend?**  
  What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?**  
  If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
- If the problem is related to working with files (e.g., opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?**

Include details about your configuration and environment:

- **Which version of Iridium HQ - Frontend are you using?**
- **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**
- **What's your Java version and type** (JRE or JDK)? (Only when you use the JAR directly.)
- **What's your Java distribution** (e.g., Oracle, OpenJDK, AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon Coretto)? (Only when you use the JAR directly.)
